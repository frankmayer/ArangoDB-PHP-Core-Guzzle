####Highlights:

- Provides Guzzle support to ArangoDB-PHP-Core
- Virtually should support any Guzzle connection handler (Curl & ReactPHP(Streams) are tested) that is supported via RingPHP 


####PHP Versions:

Tested and Supported with PHP 7.0+ & HHVM 3.15.0+ (but will most probably work from HHVM 3.11.0 onwards)


#####Caution:
This project is at the moment in a __highly experimental__ phase.
The API is not yet stable and there most probably will be significant changes to it.

So, it's not recommended to build anything critical on top of it yet. ;)
But... stay tuned...


#####Contributing

As with ArangoDB-PHP-Core, this project is also very fresh and in a highly experimental state, it's not yet open to pull requests.
